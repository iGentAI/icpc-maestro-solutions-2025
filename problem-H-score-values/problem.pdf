Problem H
Score Values
Time limit: 2 seconds
Ever since you arrived at your university, you have been a
tireless advocate for introducing the brand-new martial-artsplus-card-based sport of Contact Bridge to the school (and
the world). Finally, after a great deal of (really persistent
and annoying) advocacy on your part, you have obtained permission and funding from your dean to build a grand new
arena for the sport! Well, technically it is not so much an
“arena” as a “broom closet,” and maybe not “grand” so much
as “cramped,” and the “new” is also debatable. But the sport
of the future has to start somewhere!

Unfortunately, you just realized that you are going to need a score display in order to run the games. In
Contact Bridge, the score for a team starts at 0 and, after various repeatable actions, may be incremented
by certain fixed amounts. There is also a maximum value – if the team’s score would be incremented
above the maximum, it will instead be capped there. You want the team’s score to be visible at all times,
so you will need to prepare some signs, each with a single digit printed on it, that can be arranged to
show the score.
Unfortunately the dean’s “funding” is running short, and these signs are expensive. Figure out the
minimum set of signs you need to purchase to show any score that is possible to achieve during the
game. Note that you won’t need any 9 signs, as any 6 sign can be turned upside-down to make a 9.

Input
The first line of input contains two integers m and n, where m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1018 ) is the maximum score
value, and n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) is the number of different ways of scoring. This is followed by n lines, each
containing an integer p (1 ≤ p ≤ 1 000), which is the number of points awarded for a type of action in
the game. No two types of action are awarded the same number of points.

Output
For each digit from 0 to 8 in increasing order, output two integers: the digit and the number of signs
with that digit that you need to purchase. Omit digits where the number of signs needed is 0.
