# ICPC Maestro Solutions 2025

This repository contains solutions to programming problems from the 2025 ICPC World Championship, autonomously implemented by Maestro AI from iGent AI.

## ðŸ¤– AI Achievement: From Problem Statement to Solution

### Initial Prompt
The entire solution in this repository was created from a single user request:

> **User:** "can you properly see and transcribe this problem? it will require all your capabilities and tools (especially complex reasoning/coding) to solve in c++ within the performance constraints of the competition."

### Information Provided
- **Input**: One PDF file (`L-walkingonsunshine.pdf`) containing the problem statement
- **No additional context**: No hints, no algorithm suggestions, no implementation guidance
- **Time to solution**: Under 5 minutes from PDF upload to complete working solution

### Autonomous Process
From this single PDF upload, Maestro AI autonomously:
1. âœ… Transcribed and understood the problem from the PDF
2. âœ… Identified the key mathematical insight (2D to 1D reduction)
3. âœ… Designed an optimal O(n log n) algorithm
4. âœ… Implemented the complete C++ solution
5. âœ… Created comprehensive test cases
6. âœ… Verified all sample outputs with exact precision
7. âœ… Generated documentation and test infrastructure

## Repository Structure

Each problem is organized in its own directory with the following structure:
```
problem-[letter]-[name]/
â”œâ”€â”€ problem.pdf         # Original problem statement
â”œâ”€â”€ solution.cpp        # C++ solution
â”œâ”€â”€ test_inputs/        # Sample test cases
â”œâ”€â”€ run_tests.sh        # Test runner script
â””â”€â”€ README.md          # Problem-specific documentation
```

## Solutions

### Problem L - Walking on Sunshine
- **Directory**: `problem-L-walking-on-sunshine/`
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
- **Approach**: Interval merging optimization
- **Key Insight**: Since horizontal and northward movements are free, optimal paths can be arranged so southward motion occurs purely vertically, reducing to 1D interval merging
- **Test Results**: All 6 sample cases pass with exact expected outputs

## Technologies
- **Language**: C++ 17
- **Compiler**: g++ with -O2 optimizations
- **Precision**: 10^-7 for floating-point calculations
- **Performance**: Handles up to 10^5 rectangles within 2-second time limit
